Okay, thank you for providing your server.py file. This clarifies exactly which dependencies your application uses.

Based on your server.py content, here's the precise list of requirements for your requirements.txt file, along with the other crucial setup steps for deploying to Render:

1. Your requirements.txt File
Based on your imports, you will need:

Flask: For your web application framework.
flask-cors: For handling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) from your CORS(app) call.
pandas: For reading clean_data.csv and handling DataFrame operations.
scikit-learn: This is implicitly required because your Car-Prediction-Model.pkl is a pickle file containing a scikit-learn model, and model.predict() will rely on scikit-learn's functionalities.
gunicorn: This is a production-grade WSGI server necessary to run your Flask application robustly on Render, replacing the development-only app.run(debug=True).
Action: Create/Update requirements.txt

To ensure the exact versions that work on your local machine are used, follow these steps locally:

Open your terminal in the root directory of your Car-Price-Predictor project.
Activate your virtual environment (if you're using one).
Run: pip freeze > requirements.txt
This command will generate requirements.txt with content similar to this (versions will vary based on your environment, but they will be exact):
